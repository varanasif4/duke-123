 <h2>
    KTM AG (Kronreif & Trunkenpolz Mattighofen; formerly KTM Sportmotorcycle AG) is an Austrian motorcycle, bicycle and sports car manufacturer owned by Pierer Mobility AG and the Indian manufacturer Bajaj Auto. It was formed in 1992 but traces its foundation to as early as 1934. Today, KTM AG is the parent company of the KTM Group, consisting of a number of motorcycle brands.

KTM is known for its off-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). Since the late 1990s, it has expanded into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars – namely the X-Bow. In 2015, KTM sold almost as many street as off-road bikes.

From 2012, KTM was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Europe for four consecutive years. Globally, the company is among the leading off-road motorcycle manufacturers. In 2016, KTM sold 203,423 motor vehicles worldwide

  At the KTM AG our hard work, dedication and focus is upon creating class-leading motorcycles. So, while we have many impressive facts and figures to be proud of, we believe that these numbers are more a result of our hard work and proof of our success – rather than our reason for being in business.
  KTM AG strives to maintain a policy of transparent, timely and comprehensive information and communication with the capital market participants and the general public.
We therefore provide information on KTM’s financial situation and future development at regular intervals.

The Investor Relations Team at KTM AG is convinced that confidence in our company and products can only be secured with a transparent, timely and comprehensive information and communication policy. As a result, we aim to give investors, analysts and the general public a comprehensive insight into the current economic situation and future development.

  <p class="table" style="color: aliceblue; background-color: orangered;" >  KTM 125 DUKE 2017 - Present<br>
  The 125 DUKE meticulously manufactured, die-cast swingarm is designed and produced according to the same standards and principles as the one on the 690 DUKE R. This light alloy beauty with directly linked WP shock absorber excels in extreme torsional stiffness and outstanding tracking stability</P>

  <p class="table" style="color: aliceblue;background-color: orangered;"> KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE GT 2016 - Present<br>
    Based on the 1,301 cc engine of the 1290 Super Duke R, aka “The Beast”, the 1290 Super Duke GT is clearly the Alpha within its segment. It packs a powerful punch for fully loaded tours, has massive torque from the bottom up and lacks the need for extensive gear shifts. It’s equally happy cruising around town as it is giving superbikes a run for their money when the chips are down. The engineers took the cylinders from the 1290 Super Duke R and adapted them to a newly developed cylinder head and crankshaft to give the 1290 Super Duke GT a powerplant that perfectly fits its sovereign appearance. Or would you interpret 173 hp and 144 Nm of torque.</p>
